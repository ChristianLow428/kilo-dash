This component is on and side slopes valleys. The parent material consists of mass movement deposits. Depth to a root restrictive layer is greater than 60 inches. The natural drainage class is well drained.  Water movement in the most restrictive layer is high. Available water to a depth of 60 inches (or restricted depth) is low.
